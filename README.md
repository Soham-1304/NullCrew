Medical Risk Assessment

Overview

The Medical Risk Assessment project is a web-based tool designed to analyze patient responses in real-time and assess potential medical risks. The system dynamically adapts by asking follow-up questions based on initial responses, enhancing the precision of the diagnosis. The project leverages AI and a medical dataset for accurate health risk assessments.

Features

Natural Language Input: Users can enter symptoms in everyday language.
Real-Time Analysis: The system processes user input immediately to predict potential health risks.
Adaptive Responses: Based on the user’s initial input, the system asks relevant follow-up questions.
Data-Driven Predictions: The tool uses a robust dataset of diseases and symptoms for accurate analysis.
Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS-> React,Node
Backend: LangFlow and Python LLM Model
Dataset: Disease-Symptom dataset from Kaggle
